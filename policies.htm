        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>
          In this course, we will investigate and experiment with both conceptual and applied
          efforts to humanize technology, especially computer technology. We will question the goals
          of <em>humanization</em> and its relationship to concepts such as design ethics and
          user-centered and emotional design. While the focus of the class will be on computer
          technology and programming languages, we will also look at humanization with regard to
          technologically rich areas such as industrial design and engineering, architecture and the
          built environment, and nanotechnologies.

        <h2>Course Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand “technology” and “humanization” as being products of the manipulation of symbols at various levels from physical objects down to binary code.</li>
          <li>Engage academic and public-intellectual discourse surrounding digital technologies by both reading and writing extensively.</li>
          <li>Become adept at researching technological topics and problems, from learning how to write in different programming languages to investigating deeper theoretical/philosophical matters.</li>
          <li>Prototype and design/redesign digital technologies and interfaces for humanistic qualities, including emotional design.</li>
          <li>Develop a reflective understanding of your own learning and research processes, and the processes of others, in design, writing, and programming.</li>
          <li>Apply course concepts and adjust/extend course projects to fit your own academic and professional interests</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Course Technology Policy</h2>
        <p>
          If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it
          is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
          provided in class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to
          meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time outside of class or to
          contact me via email or GChat well in advance of project deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up
          with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it is
          <em>expected</em> that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is
          more important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
          before a project is due.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Attendance and Participation</h2>
        <p>
          Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the
          class, and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss,
          please <a href="#information">contact me</a> ahead of time via email.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
        <p>
          As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml">Code of Academic Honesty</a> from the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/">IIT Student Handbook</a>. All work for
          this course should be your own original effort, including print and digital page design
          and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
          open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
          legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part
          may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the
          work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates
          the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing
          grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities and the
          Associate Dean of Graduate Academic Affairs, who may take additional disciplinary action.
        </p>

        <h2>Special Needs Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in Life Sciences Room 218. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
        </p>
        <p>
          Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email, at the start of the semester. Methods, materials, or deadlines will be adapted as required to ensure equitable participation.
