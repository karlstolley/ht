        <h2>Ongoing Project</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Blogging (20pts)</b> You are going to blog this course, using your blogging platform of choice (e.g., WordPress, Tumblr, Posterous). You may opt to keep your blog private (though you must, of course, give access to the instructor). Be sure to make sure that the blogging platform you choose (or self-host) enables restricted access, if that is a concern to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may post about anything that you like, as often as you’d like, so long as 1) it’s in some way related to the course and 2) you’re posting in the neighborhood of 500 words a week (1000 words for COM580). Because of privacy matters relating to FERPA, do not blog about other students in the class, even if you keep your blog private.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least one post per week should be about the <cite>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</cite> book for the weeks that you are reading and working through it (see the <a href="index.htm">Calendar</a>). Tracking and reflecting on your own research and learning is a key goal of this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: if one of our reading discussions in class is not as active or lively as it should be, you may be called upon to read aloud one of your blog entries from the week leading up to that class. Therefore, think about your blogging activity as a way to get fired up about talking with others about the course work and topics.

        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Communicating Technology (25pts)</b>. For this project, you will write about some issue
          related to humanizing technology for a specific technology publication (think: Wired, Read
          Write Web, Mashable, etc.). You will have to research your topic, and present an argument.
          And because you’re writing about technology, keep in mind that “writing” can be as much
          image, video, and sound as it is standard text-based writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will begin this project by finding three Web-available pieces of technology writing
          that you find compelling because of how they are written. (In class on 1/17, we will have
          a discussion of what makes for ‘compelling’ technology writing.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also need to establish a topic to write about; we will talk about specific
          strategies for that in class, but the topic should be something that you are eager to
          research--rather than something you could write from your pool of expertise. You can write
          about a specific device (though you should have access to it), a language, a design
          method, a particular technological/design phenomenon, or anything else that you find
          intriguing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the piece that you write should engage a broad public. It should not, in other
          words, be written for an audience of hardcore tech-heads (nor should it be written for a
          group of second-graders). (In class on 1/17, we’ll talk a bit about audience regarding the
          Jacobson interview on Fresh Air.)
        </p>
        <p>Deliverables:</p>
        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>Three compelling pieces of Web-available technology writing (email links to instructor by January 24)</li>

        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Humanistic Design/Redesign (25pts)</b> (Full description coming February 2. Working in
          teams lead by a graduate student who will serve as a mentor/guide as well as a
          collaborator (not, however, as a boss), you will work to design or redesign a technology
          that solves some particular problem for some specific group of people. This might be an
          interface, a physical object, or an entire web application; it’s up to your group to
          propose a specific project.
        </p>
        <p>Goals:</p>
        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>
            <b>Engaged collaboration</b>: Oftentimes collaborative projects like this become about
            as collaborative as a vegetable tray. Tasks are divided up and accomplished, and no one
            works or talks with anyone else. Your collaboration should be much more involved and
            engaged; instead of a veggie tray, think vegetable soup. Each contribution impacts
            another, and all of the contributions must be coordinated together--not just thrown in
            individual slots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Virtual meetings</b>: Students in this class live throughout the city, and
            many of them work full-time jobs. Coming up with an online, virtual meeting/work
            strategy (perhaps mediated through something like Basecamp or Google Groups) will be an
            important learning goal, in addition to coordinating work with a group that may not be
            able to meet physically often.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Design as a process</b>: Whether your group is building an interface, a Web
            application, or a new way to access public transportation, you will look at design as a
            process: great ideas don’t just happen. They’re gradually worked out and refined over
            time. Your sketchbook deliverable is an important piece of achieving this goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Theory into application</b>: This project is your opportunity to apply the more theoretical material we’ve been reading on an actual piece of work.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Deliverables:</p>
        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>
            <b>Quick-Fire Challenge</b>: A design challenge done in class on February 21 to help
            identify ideas and interests to establish the groups for this project (there will be 4
            groups of 4 people--3 undergraduate students and one graduate student). To the extent
            possible, students will be responsible for getting into their own groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sketchbook</b>: This can be a paper sketchbook or a digital one (or both), but it
            should be something that you are comfortable turning in on April 3. (Meaning, don’t mix
            this up with your own personal diary/journal or something else where you store ideas you
            don’t want to share.) Bring this to every class; if you or your group gets stuck, you’ll
            be asked to share what you’ve been working on. (Due April 3)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Project Management Site</b>: This can be a wiki, a Google Group, a Basecamp site--or
            anything else that your group agrees upon to coordinate the work of your project.
            Instructor must also be given access &amp; will check in weekly on the group’s progress. (Due weekly; final on April 3)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Project Proposal</b>: A single, group-authored document (hint: try composing on a Wiki or in Google Docs) that outlines in detail your project deliverable, your anticipated schedule of completing the work, and materials/languages/technologies that you’ll need to complete the project. Minimum 5 pages. (Another hint: use the week of February 28 to get some of this work done during our regularly scheduled class time.) Due March 6.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>In-Progress Presentations</b>: Every week, each group will give a 5 to 10 minute
            presentation on the state of their projects. Everyone should respond to each group with
            useful feedback and questions. (Due weekly)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Design/Redesign Deliverable</b>: The big-biggie, obviously. Must be the deliverable
            that you outline in detail in your project proposal. (Due April 3)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Final Presentation</b>: A 25-minute presentation by the entire group of your final
            deliverable. Should include a demonstration and/or walk-through of the design/redesign
            deliverable.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <p><b>Position Statement on Humanizing Technology (10pts)</b> (Full description coming February 21) For this project, working alone or in small groups, you will create some kind of position statement on humanizing technology. This could take the form of a position statement on behalf of a group to which you belong at school, work, or in your personal life; or it could be a personal manifesto of sorts, articulating your views on the design, implementation, and/or use of technology. However, it should not just be a simple document; the statement should enact, technologically, the values your statement articulates. For example, if your statement calls for beautifully designed interfaces, you should create it as a beautifuly designed interface.</p>
